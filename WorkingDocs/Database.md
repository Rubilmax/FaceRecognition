# Database creation

The aim of the project is to collect pictures of the members of the group in
order to build a Database. We have taken pictures of the different members with
different angles, different poses. Firstly, we create two directories : train and tests.
Train is a directory with front view and side view from different distances to train the neural network.
The second, with more original photos, has the aim to test the ability to recognize our faces.
Then, we create a Database by renaming every picture NameOfTheMember_NumberOfThePicure.

For example :

```
Romain_4

RÃ©mi_12

Fabien_17
```
